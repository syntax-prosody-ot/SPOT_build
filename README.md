# SPOT_build
This repository contains pre-built build files spot.js and constraints.js 
to accompany the main repository (syntax-prosody-ot/main). To use them,
download both repositories and put spot.js and constraints.js in the folder
main/build.

To be sure of having the most current build files, instead run the build 
script syntax-prosody-ot/main/jsbuild.sh on your local machine.

On a UNIX system, you can do this by opening a terminal, navigating into
the main repository, and typing ./jsbuild.sh. This will create the files
spot.js and constraints.js in the build folder.
